## What are the topics covered in Chemistry Matters?

The textbook covers a wide range of topics in chemistry, from the basics of matter and atoms to the applications of chemistry in a sustainable world. Here is a brief overview of the topics covered in each chapter:

- **Matter – Structures and Properties:** This chapter introduces the concept of matter and its classification into elements, compounds, and mixtures. It also explains the structure of atoms and how they are represented by symbols and models.
- **Experimental Chemistry:** This chapter covers the skills and techniques required for conducting experiments in chemistry. It also explains how to measure physical quantities, such as mass, volume, 

    temperature,

 and time, and how to present and analyze data using tables, graphs, and calculations.
- **Kinetic Particle Theory:** This chapter explains the kinetic particle theory and how it can be used to describe the behavior of matter in different states: solid, liquid, and gas. It also covers the concepts of diffusion, changes of state, latent heat, and pressure.
- **Atomic Structure:** This chapter explores the structure of atoms in more detail, focusing on the subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. It also covers the concepts of atomic number, mass number, isotopes, relative atomic mass, electronic configuration, and ionization.
- **Chemical Bonding:** This chapter explains how atoms combine to form molecules or ions by forming chemical bonds: covalent bonds or ionic bonds. It also covers the concepts of valency, molecular formulae, structural formulae, dot-and-cross diagrams, ionic formulae, and ionic equations.
- **Structure and Properties of Materials:** This chapter explores how the structure of materials affects their properties and uses. It covers the types of materials: metals, non-metals, alloys, giant covalent structures (such as diamond and graphite), simple molecular structures (such as iodine and ice), ionic compounds (such as sodium chloride), polymers (such as polyethylene), and nanomaterials (such as carbon nanotubes).
- **Chemical Reactions:** This chapter introduces the concept of chemical reactions and how they can be classified into different types: combination reactions (synthesis), decomposition reactions (breakdown), displacement reactions (substitution), double displacement reactions (exchange), neutralization reactions (acid-base), combustion reactions (burning), redox reactions (oxidation-reduction), precipitation reactions (formation of insoluble salts), and complexation reactions (formation of complexes).
- **Chemical Formulae and Equations:** This chapter explains how to write chemical formulae and equations using symbols and numbers. It also covers the concepts of relative molecular mass,         empirical formulae,         molecular formulae,         balanced equations,         state symbols,         and mole ratios.
